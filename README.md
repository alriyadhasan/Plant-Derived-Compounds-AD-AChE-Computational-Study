# Plant-Derived-Compounds-AD-AChE-Computational-Study
This repository contains data and workflows for identifying plant-derived acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease. Using molecular docking, MM-GBSA, DFT analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluate and identify promising compounds that may serve as novel, natural treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
